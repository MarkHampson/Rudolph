Project for Nicole's ugly Christmas sweater

blink.c - makes a glowy LED for the Rudolph nose

pulseWidthTable.py - generates a an exponential table of PWM pulse widths
                     and writes it as a C header file "pulseWidthTable.h"

Used the sucky Red Hat/TI MSP430 GCC and mspdebug to flash it.
Here is the whole sequence:

    make 

    sudo mspdebug rf2500

    (mspdebug) prog msp430g2553.o
